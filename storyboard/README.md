## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: To find out the thermal conductivity of liquids

### 1. Story Outline:

The experiment is based on the Fourier law. It involves the heat conduction through sample liquid filled between two metal plates of different temperature. Hot plate is heated up using electric current and cold plate is cooled using cold water supply. Both plates contain three thermocouple each to measure temperature. The experiment is used to measure thermal conductivity of different liquids and verify heat transfer law.

### 2. Story:

First the user will select the liquid on which he has to perform the experiment. User will select water valve in open position at the inlet of the cooling water jacket and maintain constant water flow rate. The user turns on the switch on the heater. User set the heat controller or voltage regulator which adjusts power input to heater. Wait till the temperatures of both plates are constant with time that is steady state is reached. Read the temperatures on digital temperature indicator and calculate the thermal conductivity. User can verify the results and compare conductivity rate of different liquids.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
In the simulator user will be able to see the virtual prototype of experimental setup resembling the actual experiment setup. Setup consists of two metal plates of 165mm diameter placed at top of each other separated by 18mm width. The sample liquid is filled in the space between plates called sample tube. Six thermocouples are placed on the plates (three each) to measure temperature of the plates. A heating unit which provides heat to the lower metal plates using electrical energy. The user console provided with power switch, voltage regulator and display for Voltage, current, temperature.
  
#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

1. Describe the Fourier’s law of conductivity
2. calculate the conductivity of different liquids
3. compare material on basis of conductivity
4. examine the conductor and insulator materials

2. Instruction “select a sample liquid” shown near the chemical shelf<br>
3. User click on one of the sample by click on it.<br>
4. Instruction “pour the sample” shown near the funnel<br>
5. User drag the beaker to the funnel<br>
6. Animation of pouring start automatically<br>
7. Instruction “turn On the water supply” shown near the water inlet<br>
8. User tern on water supply by a click<br>
9. Instruction “turn On the heater” shown near the User console<br>
10. User switch On by click<br>
11. Instruction “adjust the heating power” shown near the User console pointing towards Voltage regulator<br>
12. User rotate / slide the Voltage regulate to adjust voltage (current also change simultaneously) and click Ok when he is ready<br>
13. Instruction “now wait to get constant temperature” shown near the User console, a timer of 15 sec appears<br>
14. As timer closes, Instruction “Note down the temperature of hot and cold plate”<br>
15. User calculate the Thermal conductivity of Liquid using formula<br>

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

1. Thermal conductivity is defined as the heat flow per unit time if <br>
  a) When the temperature gradient is unity<br>
  b) Across the wall with no temperature<br>
  c) Through a unit thickness of the wall<br>
  d) Across unit area where the temperature gradient is unity<br>

2. Lowest thermal conductivity is shown by <br>
  a) Fresh Water <br>
  b) Mercury <br>
  c) Glycerol <br>
  d) All sample has same thermal conductivity <br>
 

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
If user do not turn on the water supply the simulator will show the pop up warning. It is necessory to maintain the temperature of cooling plate constant to achieve constant heat transfer<br> 

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
User will take approximately 10 minutes for understanding the procedure. The data generation through simulator require 4-5 minutes. Further user require 15 minutes to complete the calculation and plotting graph. So, total time taken to complete experiment is 30 minutes.

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
The following formula are used in calculation:
The heat balancing equation for one dimensional flow is given by, 
For thermal conductivity of liquids using Fourier's law, the heat flow through the liquid from hot fluid to cold fluid is the heat transfer through conductive fluid medium. Fourier's equation

Q = -k A d t /d x.

Or 

Q = -k A (T2-T1) /d x.

Where 
K = Thermal conductivity of Liquid in W/m2C 
A = Area of the cylinder in m2 (A = πr2, r is radius of plate)
ΔT/ΔX = Temperature slope
q = heat supplied ( V x i )
