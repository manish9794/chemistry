| **Lab** | **(KCH-352) Heat Transfer Operation Lab** |
| **Experiment** | **1. To find out the thermal conductivity of liquids** |

**About the Lab:**

This lab delivers basic technical information about operation of heat transport methods, such as conduction, convection, and radiation. The various experiment to determine the amount of heat exchange in various modes of heat transfer including condensation & boiling for several geometries (like composite wall, lagged pipe etc).

**About the Experiment:**

The experiment involves Fourierâ€™s conductivity concept to determine the thermal conductivity of liquids. When a temperature gradient exists in a body, there is an energy transfer from the high temperature region to the low temperature region. Energy is transferred by conduction and heat transfer rate per unit area is proportional to the normal temperature gradient
